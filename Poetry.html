     <h1>Lyrics</h1>  <!--    This is one of the most mentally disturbing song, even therapy cant help to get over the pain by listening to this song-->
        <p>
I wanna hold the hand inside you<br>
I wanna take the breath that's true<br>
I look to you and I see nothing<br>
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colors your eyes with what's not there
Fade into you
Strange, you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
A stranger light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then smiles cover your heart
Fade into you
Strange, you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
Fade into you
Strange, you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
I think it's strange you never knew
        </p>
