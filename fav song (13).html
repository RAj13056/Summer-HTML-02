     <h1>Lyrics for Fade Into You by Mazzy Star</h1>  <!--This is one of the most meaningful songs of all time. -->
        <div class="song"></div>
    <div id="english" class="lyrics">
<p>I wanna hold the hand inside you</p>
<p>I wanna take a breath that's true</p>
<p>I look to you and I see nothing</p>
<p>I look to you to see the truth</p>
<p>You live your life, you go in shadows</p>    
<p>You'll come apart and you'll go blind</p>    
<p>Some kind of night into your darkness</p>    
<p>Colors your eyes with what's not there</p>    
<p>Fade into you</p>    
<p>Strange, you never knew</p>    
<p>Fade into you</p>    
<p>I think it's strange you never knew</p>    
<p>A stranger light comes on slowly</p>    
<p>A stranger's heart without a home</p>    
<p>You put your hands into your head</p>    
<p>And then smiles cover your heart</p>    
<p>Fade into you</p>    
<p>Strange, you never knew</p>    
<p>Fade into you</p>    
<p>I think it's strange you never knew</p>    
<p>Fade into you</p>    
<p>Strange, you never knew</p>    
<p>Fade into you</p>    
<p>I think it's strange you never knew</p>    
<p>I think it's strange you never knew</p>
